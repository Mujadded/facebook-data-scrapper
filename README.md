# facebook-data-scrapper

You just put your key words and run it in the page and you will get the posts.

If not any keyword it will get all the visible post in the page as json data


for now the data is only

```
{
  "link": "The link of the post",
  "title": "The title of the post",
}
```

but you can modify to get more info


## just for fun project
